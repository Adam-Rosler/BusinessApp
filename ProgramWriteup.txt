Tracking Number Handler Program (backend software):
grabs the tracking number email, and inserts into database for each corresponding order, runs every 5-10 minutes updating the data.
when a tracking email is not found, will let the user know so they can add it in
	-uses the imap data I have, adding any and every email that corresponds with the given Order number

Order Lookup / Prep Program (for employees):
Allows user to update recieved inventory and prep the inventory
	-works based off the tracking number handler since the any data will be looked up through there


Inventory Adder Program (for me):
Allows user to add a specified asin to the order database
	-gets updated by google spreadsheets backend
